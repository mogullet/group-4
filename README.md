# Analysis of supermarket data across 3 branches over 3 months

#### This project is a python coding assignment. It was given to us to test our ability to apply python coding and associated libraries, in reference to tabular datasets. We have used such, to find associations in the data that may have previously not been possible to have been acrued from the dataset either quickly, or obviously, from 'normal' data processing techniques.  

## Libraries used: 

### For data manipulation we used:
1. Pandas,
2. Numpy.

### For data visualisation we used:
3. Matplotlib,
4. Seaborn.

## Dataset used and where it can be obtained:
Dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The data set used was Supermarket sales by Aung Pyae: [Supermarket sales, Historical data of sales data in 3 different supermarkets](https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales).
